<p>Robotics, in various forms, has existed for quite a while. 
Precisely how long depends on what you classify as the "first" instance - 
clockwork automata are known to have existed for up to two thousand years, whereas the modern electric robot has only been around for about half a century.

With these great changes comes a great deal of issues to consider. </p>

<p>This site seeks to cover a couple of areas within robotics and discuss the various implications thereof. These are:
