While using the drone for surveillance purposes the restrictions are a lot stricter, there is specific distance that the drone is required to keep between it and people or any private properties. You are however allowed to fly a drone in public areas like park as long as it’s kept 150 meters above the area. <a class="reference">(Smashing Drones, 2017)</a></p>
