<h2>What happens to us?</h2>

<p>That is the question that most people will ask as more jobs will be taken over by automated systems, but sadly that
is the price to pay for progression. As technology gets better and as the need for robotics becomes an ever 
increasing necessity, companies will end up replacing whole work forces with robotic counterparts, which will put 
more people out of a job and may even prevent some people to get jobs becasuse machines are better at doing them.</p>
