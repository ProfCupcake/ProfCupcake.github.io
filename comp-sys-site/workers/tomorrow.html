<h2>Automated workers of the future</h2>

<p>As robotics gets more advanced we see it starting to be used and developed in a way that can benifit humans in a
brilliant way. In medical industry there are some interesting robots being created to help us, for example there 
areserveral robots being made that can help nurses they range from getting patientsin and out of bed, as well as 
taking blood, which can ease work loads on nurses. Although nurses are not the only ones with robotic assistance,
surgeons in some facilities have access to 'The da Vinci Surgical System' that is able to be used in several types 
of surgery such as:
<ul>
	<li>Cardiac Surgery</li>
	<li>Colorectal Surgery</li>
	<li>General Surgery</li>
	<li>Gynecologic Surgery</li>
	<li>Head &amp; Neck Surgery</li>
	<li>Thoracic Surgery</li>
	<li>Urologic Surgery</li>
</ul>

<p>The advantages to using robotic surgery include the following: 
<ul>
	<li>Fewer complications, such as surgical site infection</li>
	<li>Less pain and blood loss</li>
	<li>Quicker recovery</li>
	<li>Smaller, less noticeable scars</li>
</ul>
