<p>This guide is intended to provide a quick crash-course in Git and how you can contribute to our projects using it. It's a powerful tool, but is rather opaque to new users and can be very temperamental if you get something wrong. This guide won't teach you everything about it, but it will give you the basic knowledge needed to perform the essential operations in Git. </p>

<p>Firstly, you'll want to acquire a Git client. The recommended one (and the one that this guide is about) is the one direct from the Git project themselves, found here: <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a>. You will also need to create an account on GitHub.</p>
