<p>Arma3Sync can be a pretty intimidating program if you don’t know what you’re doing with it. This guide is here to
make it a little less intimidating by explaining how to use it to connect to 2MRB’s mod repo, download the mod files
and use the Events system to acquire preset mod groups.</p>
<p>To this end, each page will deal with a different subject, as you can see. </p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>There are a couple things you'll need to make sure you have before you start using our repo.</p>
<h2>1. Arma3Sync (obviously)</h2>
<p>This can be downloaded here:-</p>

<h2>2. CUP Terrains</h2>
<p>Because of its extreme size, CUP Terrains has been excluded from the repo, and must be downloaded separately. It can be acquired from the official website here (you’ll want the Complete pack):-</p>
<p><a href="http://cup-arma3.org/download">http://cup-arma3.org/downloads/</a></p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the file, extract it into your Arma 3 root directory. If you don’t know where that is, you can find it easily by right-clicking Arma 3 in Steam, going to the “Local Files” tab, and clicking “Browse Local Files”.</p>
<p>Once it’s extracted, make sure to add it to a group in Arma3Sync, so that you can have it selected for use in-game. This can be done from the tab that Arma3Sync starts up in, by right-clicking the right-hand area and clicking “New Group”. Name it whatever you want, though something practical like, say, “CUP Terrains” is obviously recommended. Then just drag “@CUP_Terrains” from the left-hand pane over into the group you just created.</p>
