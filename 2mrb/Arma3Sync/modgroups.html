<p>Before you can actually use mods with Arma3Sync, they need to be added to mod groups. This is a fairly simple process.</p>
<p>On the addons screen, right-click on the right-hand pane, then click "Add Group". Name it something, like "Geoffrey", "Steve", or "2MRB Standard". It'll then appear on the right. To add mods to it, just drag them over from the left and drop them onto it. </p>
<p>To start Arma with the mod group, check the box next to it. You can also expand the group and select individual mods to enable/disable, as well as enable other groups or mods to also run with. </p>
<p>Your 2MRB mod group should, at minimum, contain the set of required mods for us. There is a list of modfolder names in the Discord, in #modlist-reference, that you can use to check everything's there.</p>
<p>That's about it for this section. Probably not worth an entire page, huh. Here's a dancing dinosaur to make up for that:</p>
<img src="assets/dance_of_the_dino.gif" title="The dance of the dinosaur gives us strength." alt="An animated dancing dinosaur. If you're seeing this text, it didn't load for you. That sucks. I feel sorry for you, having never experienced the dinosaur's dance. Alternatively, you could just be snooping around with the developer console. In which case, HEY STOP SNOOPING THAT'S RUDE."/>
