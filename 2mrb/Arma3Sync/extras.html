<p>Arma3Sync has a couple of other features that may come in useful. </p>
<h2>Server Selection</h2>
<p>Arma3Sync allows you to select a server before starting the game. If you start the game with a server selected, you will launch the game directly into said server.</p>
<p>If you’ve used the autoconfig earlier to access the repo, our server’s details will have already been added to your Arma3Sync. To select it, simply open up the big drop-down box that’s at the bottom of the window.</p>
<h2>Launch Options</h2>
<p>These are a selection of launch parameters, which Arma3Sync has a handy interface for altering. Navigating to the “Launch Options” tab will allow you to access this. Some of these can improve performance if set up correctly, so it’s worth a look.</p>
<h3>Show Script Errors</h3>
<p>This will display the error on the screen if any scripts encounter errors. This is only really useful if you’re a modder, scripter or mission maker, but can also be handy for debugging in general.</p>
<h3>Max Memory</h3>
<p>This defines the amount of graphics memory allocated to Arma 3. You’ll usually want this maxed out, and Arma3Sync conveniently detects your maximum and sets the drop-down box accordingly.</p>
<h3>CPU Count</h3>
<p>This defines how my CPU cores will be used by Arma. Again, you’ll probably want to just max this one, and again Arma3Sync will detect how many CPU cores you have.</p>
<h3>exThreads</h3>
<p>This one defines how processes are handled on extra threads. For those of you who understand the technical side of things, it’s a bitwise value where a high value means it is given an extra thread. The first bit is for geometry loading, the second for texture loading and the third for file operations. If you didn’t understand that, you can use this rule of thumb: if you have four CPU cores or more, set it to 7. If not, leave it alone.</p>
<h3>No Splash Screen</h3>
<p>This simply removes the flashy introduction when you first start up the game.</p>
<h3>Default World Empty</h3>
<p>This will set the default world to a completely empty one. This is the world that is used for the menu background, meaning that setting it to an empty one can greatly improve the time it takes to first load into the menu screen. </p>
