<p>Welcome! These guides are intended to give good instruction to you about various oft-used aspects of our operations. They primarily concern things that fulfill one simple criterion: it's something that you'll be using a lot and/or are unlikely to avoid.</p>

<a href="Arma3Sync/index.html"><h2>Arma3Sync Repo Guide</h2></a>
<p>The group has its own Arma3Sync Repo, which is the recommended method for acquiring our modset (and the only properly supported one). This guide will run you through the basics of connecting and downloading, show off a couple of fancy extra features, and (hopefully) help with any issues you run into thanks to its troubleshooting section. </p>
