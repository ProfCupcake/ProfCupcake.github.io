<h1 style="text-align:center">Loadouts</h1>
<p>Before I begin this part, it's worth mentioning that the following are just recommendations, or guidelines; you do not have to stick to them to the letter. Indeed, for many loadouts, you probably won't be able to anyway. Instead, use these as a guide and adapt them to suit your loadout, taking more or less depending on how much space/weight you can spare.</p>
<p>As a non-medic, there are essentially two options available to you for your loadout. You can either take an even spread of all 4 bandage types, or you can take just 1 (usually QuikClots). As an additional to this, you'll have to decide how many of the two effectual injectors to take. Remember that the supplies you carry are not always just for yourself; it will greatly help your medic(s) (and the unit as a whole) to have extra medical supplies spread across the members of the unit.</p>
<p>So, in summary, here are the two basic options:</p>
<table class="columnStyle">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<h2>Option 1 (recommended)</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>4-8x each bandage type</li>
				<li>2-4x Morphine</li>
				<li>1-2x Epinephrine</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
		<td>
			<h2>Option 2 (alternate)</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>8-12x QuikClot</li>
				<li>2-4x Morphine</li>
				<li>1-2x Epinephrine</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
